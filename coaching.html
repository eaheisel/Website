            <p>The job of an instructional coach encompasses four major roles: leading Professional Learning Communities (PLC), developing and providing professional development (PD), coaching cycles, and co-teach/team teaching. I empower teachers to use technology in innovative ways through each of my four responsibilities.</p> 
       <h2>Professional Learning Communities</h2>
            <p>Each week, grade levels meet for a 80 minute PLC meeting. During these meetings we unpack standards, dive into data, plan lessons, model the use of ed tech tools, and plan for student engagement, empowerment, and creativity.</p>
        <h2>Professional Development</h2>
            <p>Over the past six years, I have provided numerous sessions on various ed tech tools. These sessions are part of the digital learning initiative I started at my school. Educators who attend the mini PD sessions are introduced to an ed tech tool, experience using the tool themselves, and learn how to use it as a teacher. Once educators attend the session, they are encouraged to utilize the ed tech tool with their students in the classroom. Teachers invite me to see the implementation of the tool in a lesson and then are provided a certificate to show that they have successfully used the tool.</p>
        <h2>Coaching Cycles</h2>
            <p>As educators, we are lifelong learners and have the desire to improve our practice so that we can be effective teachers. It is my responsibility to discuss areas for improvement with teachers, develop goals, and create a plan of action to reach those goals. These things are done through a coaching cycle. If student engagement, student empowerment, rigor, or critical thinking is an area for growth, many times I will encourage teachers to create a goal to utilize ed tech tools in their classrooms.</p>
        <h2>Co-Teaching & Team Teaching</h2>
            <p>Co-teaching and team teaching gives me the opportunity to model using ed tech tools in the classroom. As a result, teachers can see the power of technology and how their students have become empowered.</p>
