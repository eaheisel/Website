		<h2>Education</h2>
               <p>I received my undergraduate degree from Hope College in Holland, MI in 2009. I am currently working on my masters in Learning Design and Technology at NC State.</p>
        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>I currently work at an elementary school in Fayetteville, NC. I was hired as a fifth grade teacher and taught for seven years. I have been an instructional coach for the last six years. Utilizing technology in the classroom is a passion of mine. I love seeing students use digital tools to create, think critically, and become empowered. </p>
		<h2>Coaching</h2>
				<p>My current role as an instructional coach allows me to model for and empower teachers to use technology in innovative ways. This will further empower students, give them a voice, and provide them with an opportunity to think critically and be creative. You can find out more about my role as a coach by visiting my <a href="coaching.html">coaching</a> page.</p>
