		<h2>Education</h2>
               <p>I received my undergraduate degree from Hope College in Holland, MI in 2009. I am currently working on my masters in Learning Design and Technology at NC State.</p>
        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>I currently work at an elementary school in Fayetteville, NC. I was hired as a fifth grade teacher and taught for seven years. I have been an instructional coach for the last six years. Utilizing technology in the classroom is a passion of mine. I love seeing students use digital tools to create, think critically, and become empowered. </p>
